            Elden Ring is a game that is made by the same people who made the 'soulsborn' games; a collection of games known for their brutal difficulty.
            <br>
            The games are difficult but what makes them harder is the unorthodox ways that the player is not informed about the in game mechanics and nuances of the game are up to the player to discover for themselves, or research online.
            <br>
            The games all control inthe same way; there's a loose 3rd person camera, you can click the right stick to spot and lock onto an enemy and you have to defeat an area boss.
            <br>
            The narrative is driven forward by, sometimes vague, interactions with NPC's who are few and far between.
            <br>
            These NPC's may have questionable intentions, be deluded, be misinformed or just generally act as unreliable narrators with their own intentions.
            <br>
            It is up to the player to interpret what is going on in the game world and decide what the narrative is, so as to make the best possible decisions when these interactions occur.</p>

        <p class="linegaps eyesooth">
            While on your travels you will find campfire like objects which act as waypoints, or resting places that you will return to if you die.
            <br>
            Being killed is where these games are a bit strange; the player is immortal and the world is persistant. 
            <br>
            When you are killed all the doors you opened or unlocked stay that way and all the items you found are still in your inventory. 
            <br>
            Enemies however respawn same as the player, and you have the option of returning to where you died to recover your souls.
            <br>
            If you are having a successful run you may have to decide whether to return to a bonfire to level up, respawning all enemies; or you can face the boss now and risk losing all your hard earned souls, and having to do it all again anyway.
            <br>
            In older games, souls were the currency you recieved for killing enemies, allowing you to level you up or buy things from vendors.</p>
        <p class="linegaps eyesooth">
            Elden Ring changes the names of things in insignificant ways; 'souls' are now refered to as 'runes', 'bonfires' are now called 'lost graces' etc. but the formula remains the same; fight enemies, loot items, level up, fight the area boss, move to the next area, repeat.</p>
        <p class="linegaps eyesooth">
            There is a returning multiplayer element that is surprisingly well thought out. The player can write messages, which can be used to help other players, or rate messages they are reading. 
            <br>
            You can write your 'summon sign' on the floor which allows other people who can see your glowing writing on the floor to summon you to their world so you can help them take down the boss. 
            <br>
            By using a certain item you can summon people to your game (so that you are the host). 
            <br>
            The host, or summoner is then vulnerable to being invaded buy human players who want to join your world as an enemy.
            <br>
            There are various ways you can engage in network play, or you can play offline and leave it all out, and instead summon AI helpers that you collect as reward items.</p>

        <p class="linegaps eyesooth">
            There are also player ghosts which phase in and out of your instance, and you in theirs for a few seconds. 
            <br>
            This shows you what other players are doing and vice versa for a few seconds.
            <br>
            You can also interact with bloodstains of players who recently died where you are stood, this allows you to catch a glimpse of a potential hazard ahead.</p>
        <p class="linegaps eyesooth">
            The game borrows the open world elements from 'Zelda: Breath of the Wild'.
            <br>
            The crafting system is another thing that is heavily influenced by other games, allowing you to customize the equipment you have to hand, for example throwing knives made from animal bones.
            <br>
            Exploring is always potentially dangerous, particularly if you are underleveled, but there are lot's of interesting secrets and underworlds to discover.</p>
        <p class="linegaps eyesooth">
            It's worth mentioning the game has a really decent character creater and there are loads of ways to spec a character in unique ways.
            <br>
            Upgrading weapons, once you unlock NPC's who can do it to high levels for you is addictive and makes trying new combinations fun.
            <br>
            There are dozens of weapons that all have unique attributes and animations, ranging from melee weapons like swords and pole axes, to ranged weapons and grafted body parts that replace limbs (like a dragon's undead head instead of a left hand.
            <br>
            Each weapon makes your character standout in every way.</p>
        <p class="linegaps eyesooth">
            The last point I want to make is that although certain aspects of the game are more accessible than in the predessessors, Elden Ring gradually gets harder and harder until character stats stop really mattering and it's more about out-skilling them, or cheesing the game using vantage points etc.</p>
