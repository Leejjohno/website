        <h3 class="game_title">Free Radical Design<br>October 2002</h3> 
        <p class="linegaps eyesooth"> 
            First lets talk about the origins of this game. What people may not know is that Free Radical Design was founded by key members of the Rare team that made Golden Eye, which was considered to be the first classic console party shooter.
            <br>
            Because of this TimeSplitters was a spiritual successor to Golden Eye and had the retro controls of that era where you would be controlling the hand holding the gun rather than the crosshair-in-the-centre style of game we are now used to.</p>

        <p class="linegaps eyesooth">  
            TimeSplitters 2 has all the best parts of its predecessor with a fair amount of added improvements.
            <br>
            The game features a story mode which has fully voiced characters and animated cutscenes, even if it is just an intro cutscene.
            <br>
            There's a challenge mode again, this time with more scenarios, characters, cheats and maps to unlock.
            <br>
            Some of the maps now feature destructible objects, controllable gun emplacements and remote turrets etc.
            <br>
            The map maker has been improved now so that the player can create their own missions using triggers and events, on top of creating new multiplayer maps which was pretty robust before. 
            <br>
            This is something that is sorely missing from games these days.</p>

        <p class="linegaps eyesooth">  
            The clunkiness of the aim system allowed for some hilarious moments where two people couldn't hit eachother particularly well unless they were looking dead on at eachother, or where a launched grenade bounces off a wall and returns to the user.
            <br> 
            To compensate there was a sticky-aim system which would lock on to other players or ai while the player was looking in the general direction of an enemy.
            <br>
            The AI bots are beautifully animated and have different sets of animations to each other depending on what they are doing.
            <br>
            For example, if one of the enemy bots is a hero from the game's story they will baseball slide as they pick up a weapon to throw off your aim; a particularly agile character might do back flips away from you.
            <br>
            This often adds to the hilarity of the cartoony, light hearted nature of the game.</p> 
        <p class="linegaps eyesooth">    
            I see this game as the best of the three games in the series, simply because by the time TimeSplitters 3 released with it's narrative-driven linear gameplay, heavier pop-culture references, vehicles, set-piece based action sequences, blood effects and punchy shooting it was already feeling like an outdated funnier version of the Half-Life games.
            <br>
            That said it was still an improvement on TimeSplitters 2 in most ways, most notable was the online play feature which was in it's element on the Xbox and just about functional on Playstation 2.</p>
