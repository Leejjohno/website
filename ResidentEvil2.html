        <h2>Resident Evil 2</h2>
        <h3 class="game_title">Capcom<br>January 2019</h3> 

        <p class="linegaps eyesooth">
            Resident evil 2 is the second game in the series, also known by the title Biohazard 2 in Japan.
            <br>
            Resident Evil games are known for their classic survival horror gameplay mechanics such as fixed third person camera angles, stop-aim-shoot action and inventory management.
            <br>
            The tanky controls and movement, though restrictive and archaic in other genres, made Resident Evil more atmospheric by giving the player the sense of being genuinely vulnerable.
            <br>
            The player was naturally encouraged to think strategically before moving from safe room to safe room, while baring the aforementioned mechanics in mind.
            <br>
            The games were the best at what they did and few other game series came close to matching it in terms of quality.</p>

        <p class="linegaps eyesooth">
            Jump forward more than two decades and we have Resident Evil 2 (Remake), remade by Capcom with a more modern take on the same style of gameplay.
            <br>
            Straight away players will notice the graphics are incredible.
            <br>
            Character models are well detailed, to the point that they react to weather effects.
            <br>
            If you get bitten by a zombie you can even see bite holes in the character models clothing.</p>

        <p class="linegaps eyesooth">
            There are two playable characters in the main game; Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield.
            <br>
            There are some extra playable characters in other game modes when you finish the Game.</p>
        <p class="linegaps eyesooth">
            Before the game starts you choose Leon or Claire to play through the game as and the other character follows an alternate path.
            <br>
            After meeting eachother for the first time, and being forced to abandon their vehicles, they head to the City.
            <br>
            Leon is a rookie police recruit who is coming in for his first day after being belayed for a week.
            <br>
            Claire is looking for her brother, a S.T.A.R.S. member from the first resident evil game who happens to be her brother as he has gone missing.</p>

        <p class="linegaps eyesooth">
            The game is set mostly in three locations, the first and most prominent being the Raccoon City Police Department.
            <br>
            The station it's self is a rustic, distressed and (not quite) abandoned building with lots of interesting areas to explore, each subtly infering some other incident occured a few hours before either character got there.
            <br>
            Each area has (at first) a few enemies to deal with puzzles to be solved and doors to be unlocked. </p>

            <img src="re2street.jpg" alt="Raccoon City streets on fire and full of monsters">

        <p class="linegaps eyesooth">    
            The atmosphere is so heavy in the station that it has a personality of it's own.
            <br> 
            The camera is just over the main characters right shoulder at all times, giving the game a modern 3rd person shooter feel, while adding a penalty to the characters aim if they want to shoot and move.</p>

            <img src="re2stationj.jpg" alt="Police station exterior">

        <p class="linegaps eyesooth">
            The sound design is absolutely sublime, going so far as to change the way sounds are depending on where you are.
            <br>
            If you are in a marble floored coridor your footsteps will have an unpleasant echo, making you feel betrayed by Leons heavy boots (it took a while for me to realise walking is considered to be silent if you want to sneak; monsters cannot hear you when you are walking, though some can sense you if you are close enough).
            <br>
            Claire eventually unlocks a suppressor for one of her guns which can be used to trick monsters into going to where a bullet landed.
            <br>
            Monsters react to sound realisticly and will move to where they heard gunshots (except lickers, if you make your presense known they will aggro to wherever you are until you leave the room).
            <br>
            Hanging fixtures like ceiling fans and chandaliers, creaking noises on wooden floor boards, a monster pittering along an exterior wall are all things that utilise directional sound.</p>

            <img src="res2.jpg" alt="Abandoned police station lobby">

        <p class="linegaps eyesooth">
            The game explains the strange themes of the police station, such as the card themed keys for certain doors (diamond key, spade key etc) with a simple pamphlet left over from when the police station was a museum.
            <br>
            I guess somebody on the team knew it was probably weird having puzzles involving medalions and secret tunnels in a police station.</p>
        <p class="linegaps eyesooth">
            Once the player has sufficiently unlocked enough doors and solved enough puzzles they will be introduced to my personal favourite element in the game; the tyrant, or Mr X as he is affectionately known.
            <br>
            the tyrant is an unkillable 8ft tall mutant who patrols the police station looking for the player character. 
            <br>
            If you run and he's in the next room he will hear you and move to where he thinks you are, barging inconvienient zombies out of the way as he power walks in your direction.
            <br>
            If you fire a loud weapon or throw a grenade he will hear you from anywhere in the station and head to your last known position, quickly.
            <br>
            If he is persuing you he has a themetune which plays as long as he knows where you are, adding to the creep-factor.</p>
        <p class="linegaps eyesooth">
            The tyrant reinvigorates the player's need to plan their approach.
            <br>
            Do you bring an extra backup weapon that can be used if Mr X has grabbed you to make him let go (knives, flashbangs, grenades etc.)?
            <br>
            Should you go the long way round to avoid him acquiring you or do you go a shorter route where you will potentially have to shoot some other enemies and attract his attention?
            <br>
            Should you waste ammo knocking him down to one knee for half a minute while you press on, or try to run past him, potentially getting hit in the process?
            <br>
            The aforementioned sound design really shines through in these moments as you can hear Mr X's footsteps, which are so loud you can hear him barging into and sweeping rooms on different floors, scanning for the player, occasionally stopping to reconsider his approach.
            <br>
            You can literally hear him thinking as his footsteps stop dead in the middle of a room.</p>
        <p class="linegaps eyesooth">
            Resident Evil 2 is a game that completely embodies old school horror, reimagined in a new way.</p>
